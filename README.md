Throughout this book, you develop a text-based adventure game called The Crypt. Players can explore locations on a map, moving from place to place and picking up items to help them solve challenges and get past obstacles. The last section of each chapter uses what you’ve learned to develop the game further. You’ll see how the programming concepts help you build the pieces that are then combined to produce a large program.
